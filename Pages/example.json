A pulse oximeter provides a non-invasive\nway to monitor the oxygen saturation of the patientsâ€™ blood. This is\nsignificant because monitoring the saturation of blood in the body can help\nindicate underlying medical problems such as problems in the circulatory and\nrespiratory systems. Therefore, we see its use in a range of medical settings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Supreme LL TT&quot;, serif; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">There\nare a range of already existing pulse oximeters that are widely used which\ngenerally consist of a clip which contains a optical sensor circuit which will attach\nto either a finger, toes or ear. The output of this circuit is then sent to a\nfiltering and amplification circuit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Supreme LL TT&quot;, serif; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">The reason\nan optical sensor circuit is used is because the pulse oximeter works based on\nlight-absorption characteristics of haemoglobin in blood. The higher percentage\nof oxygen in the blood, the more infrared light will be absorbed compared to\nred light when passing the light through the skin tissue. This is measured by\nobserving the intensity of the received light using the optical sensor circuit.\nThe volume of blood of the patient is a function of the arterial pulse. Blood absorbs\nmost the light passing through the tissue and hence the intensity of the light\nis inversely proportional to the volume of blood present in the tissue. Because\nof this the signal received is small and experiences significant noise. This is\nwhy the filtering and amplification sections of the circuit are required. The haemoglobin\noxygen saturation can then be found by observing the light absorbed by two\ndifferent wavelengths, and hence the use of both the red and IR LED.<o:p></o:p></span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 16pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Supreme LL TT&quot;, serif; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">The\nratio of normalised absorbance is calculated to account for the different\nabsorbance coefficients of both oxyhemoglobin and its deoxygenated form. From\nthe ratio of normalised absorbance, the blood oxygen level can be calculated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>",

This pulse oximeter successfully was able to\nproduce an output representing the heart beat rate of the finger, which could\nthen be used to calculate accurate normalised absorbance ratios and the blood\nsaturation level.&nbsp;<br>A high and low pass filter was successfully applied but the\nmeasured gain was less than what was designed for when theoretically calculated however it lied within reasonable range.\nValid&nbsp;heart rate readings were able to be recorded using the sensor of\nwhich $90\\text{BPM}$ and $106\\text{BPM}$were found from the data. The recorded\n$S_pO_2$ value was slightly out of range from the usually range of $95 - 100\\%$\nhowever was still reliable. Overall the device was able to successfully detect\nthe heart rate and the outcomes of the project provided significant insight into\na real life applicable circuit and circuit design process.<br><br><br></p>",
