The rich text input field can contain
multiple lines. On each line formatted text
can be created and given a set of properties.

- rich-text
   - get value
   - props
   - lines
     - props
     - children
       - formatted text
          - data
          - props
       - plain text
          - data

No formatted text inside another formatted text.

The rich text field can parse html or text into
valid lines and paste it into any selection.

The rich text field can switch between a display
and edit mode. When switching to display a markdown
can be applied in order to display things such as
math text.

At any point the rich text field will return a string
representation of it and its contents, without markdown.

Properties for both line and format can be set at any time.

  Single selection
    changes made to line are instant,
    changes made to format take effect only if
    preceeding a text character key press.

  Ranged selection
    changes made to line are instant
    chages made to format are instant

    Ranged selection between multiple lines
      changes made to all lines
      changes made to format are instant
